# Advantch Django AlpineJS Tutorial

## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.7

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform 
in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### Virtual Enviornment

We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. 
This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. 
Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in
 the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
